            Thanks to all the people who ordered the Mini. We are happy to say that we are shipping a day early! We'll 
            be sending out email notices with a tracking number for each order soon. Expect to get your Minis in a few days.</p>
        <p>
            We’ve been working very long hours getting everything set. Many early adopters of bitcoin have low 
            expectations of bitcoin companies’ ability to deliver product on time. We couldn’t let ourselves 
            miss the promised shipping date. We are a very small operation, funding the project ourselves at 
            this point, so you can imagine the late nights we’ve put in. Our first US customers are getting their 
            Minis early, and we hope to open up to international customers in the next couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>
            We had to choose our hardware and software pretty carefully. For example, we use the compact Arch 
            distro of Linux, the compact Arch Linux and Node.js were chosen for their lightweight, wide use, 
            and security. We are open source from head to toe, and improvements in the future will follow 
            that same ethos. It’s important to us to encourage our customers to examine their Mini’s and 
            build their own programs for it. The Mini is not just a [bitcoin] full node, we want to open a 
            new ecosystem, one which sits on a bitcoin full node in the home. We hope to add more decentralization 
            to the network, while providing an avenue for new apps.</p>
        <p>
            In the last two weeks we were able to shrink our code down to offer a more streamlined structure 
            for others to build applications for the Mini. That process is still evolving, but the promise of 
            an ecosystem of apps built just for a personal bitcoin full node, beyond a Bitcoin Core wallet, is 
            very exciting to us, and we are trying our best to make it easy. We’ve already spoken to several 
            developers about bundling their software on the Mini with positive responses.</p>

            Today the Bitcoin Mini Team is announcing the release of the Bitcoin Mini v 1.0, a plug-and-play bitcoin full node.
            Their aim with the Mini is to provide a simple solution enabling customers to manage,
            interact with, and support the decentralization of bitcoin.
            It boasts a full stack of open-source software, one step setup, and webpage style interface.</p>
        <p>
            Six months ago, two friends seasoned in bitcoin
            set out to build a no-hassle solution to boost the decentralization of bitcoin.
            When they started the Mini project, there were no simple, affordable, standalone full nodes for consumers on
            the market. Their key insight was seeing the need for a “set it and forget it”
			way to strengthen the network and cast a vote for decentralization. They bootstrapped the project,
            creating a full stack of software including a growing personal bitcoin API running
            on the built-in server. The team has plans to offer similar products for most
            major cryptocurrencies. They are proud of the comparibility of
            this product to other comparable projects that have raised over $100 million.</p>
        <p>
            The Mini enters the market providing beginners or power users just the
            right combination of hardware and software. The team is offering a
            pre-order discounted price of $149. Mining bitcoin isn't the only thing
            that nodes can do. Simply running a full node in your home strengthens the
            network by validating transactions and securing the network. That means your
            bitcoin investment is more secure. The Mini costs only pennies a day to run, plug-and-play,
            and gives you peace of mind that the network is healthy.</p>
